Tacco
=====
"Talk is cheap.  Tacco is free."

Tacco is a docco-inspired documentor for python.

Usage
-----
    ./test.sh

_Or..._
    python tacco.py > test.html

Warning
-------
- Still in development; templating not finished.  Still requires pystache 
  integration to align code and documentation regions.
